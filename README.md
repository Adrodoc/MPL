Minecraft Programming Language (MPL), forked by glatteis

What is MPL?
-----------
MPL is a language that makes it easier to write applications for Minecraft 1.9 or higher.
The final result of compiling an MPL-Application are commandblocks that can be imported into your world in various ways.
MPL comes with it's own Editor that supports syntax- and error-highlighting and has a built in compiler.

For an advanced example application written in MPL see [ApertureCraft Vanilla](https://github.com/Adrodoc55/ApertureCraftVanilla)

While MPL can be used to create very complex commandblock applications, it is also very easy to use for small projects.
To use the commandblock generator you don't even need to know about any Mpl-specific syntax.

You can find a tutorial for Mpl [here](https://github.com/Adrodoc55/MPL/wiki/Tutorial)

This is a forked version, I will add some of my own ideas to it.
