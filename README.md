Minecraft Programming Language (MPL)
====================================

Author: Adrodoc55

What is MPL?
-----------
MPL is a language that makes it easier to write applications for Minecraft 1.9 or higher.
The final result of compiling an MPL application are command blocks that can be imported into your world in various ways.
MPL comes with it's own editor that supports syntax- and error-highlighting and has a built in compiler.

For an advanced example application written in MPL see [ApertureCraft Vanilla](https://github.com/Adrodoc55/ApertureCraftVanilla)

While MPL can be used to create very complex command block applications, it is also very easy to use for small projects.
To use the command block generator you don't even need to know about any MPL specific syntax.
